# Hi people 🤷‍

I'm probably overthinking something...

Mostly:
- Climate crisis 🔥🌎🔥
- Political polarization.
- Decreasing level of social empathy.
- Decrease of quality of almost anything.
- DevOps is not a role.
- Living in Data (really, stop reading that list of complains and go get some good read from Jer Thorp -> [*"Living in Data"*](https://www.jerthorp.com/)).

So kids, the lesson is, that overthinking rarely leads you to optimisitic conclusion. Hope it makes your life bit easier.
